# Software-Engineering-for-Cybersecurity

This project is a secure machine translation system made for the legal company Bluey, Bingo & Associates. The goal is to provide employees with a safe internal platform to translate text between English, Dutch, and Bulgarian without using public online tools that collect or store data. The system focuses on being secure, fast, and easy to use. Each employee has their own private space, and the platform includes user authentication, data encryption, and caching to make translations quick and safe. It runs on a cloud-based distributed system, supports multiple components like a translation engine, database, and caching service, and follows modern security practices to protect all information.

In short, this project creates a private and efficient translation tool that keeps company data safe while helping employees work more easily.
